/**
 * The rollout script and the committed migration must describe the SAME
 * columns.
 *
 * They are written twice on purpose — the script is what PRODUCTION gets
 * (before the deploy that selects these columns), the migration is what a fresh
 * CI/dev database gets — and nothing else in the repo notices when the two
 * drift. CI's `migrations` job would eventually catch a difference by diffing
 * against production, but only AFTER the script has been run there, which is
 * exactly the wrong time to find out.
 *
 * Importing the script must NOT open a connection or read DATABASE_URL: all of
 * that sits behind the isMainModule guard, the same shape apply-receipt-intake
 * has.
