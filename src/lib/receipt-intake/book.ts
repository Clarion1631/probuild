/**
 * Booking step — turn a READ intake row into a QuickBooks Purchase and a
 * ProBuild Expense (docs/plans/PHASE-1-INTAKE-CORE-SPEC.md §4, book.ts).
 *
 * This writes REAL BOOKS. Two rules shape everything below:
 *
 *  1. There is exactly ONE QBO write core, `createQBReceiptPurchase`
 *     (src/lib/qbo-receipt-push.ts). It is imported and called directly — never
 *     re-implemented, and never reached by HTTP from this worker. Its
 *     idempotency (DocNumber = fileId.slice(0,21) + the [gtr-file:...]
 *     PrivateNote marker + a QBO requestid) is what makes a retry safe.
 *  2. A 4xx-class business rejection is TERMINAL. Retrying a document QBO has
 *     already refused just burns the row's attempts and hides the problem; it
 *     goes to a human instead. Only transport-class failures retry.
 *
 * Every external effect is injected (`BookDependencies`), so the whole decision
 * tree is testable without QuickBooks, Supabase, or a database
 * (tests/receipt-intake-book.test.ts). No module mocking — CI is Node 20.
